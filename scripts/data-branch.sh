# The data branch, for the digest workflow (.github/workflows/digest.yml): main
# with one commit on top, holding data/, the last published digest. Each run
# starts from main's code with that digest, and replaces the branch with main
# plus one new commit, so no history piles up and the data
# always sits on main's current code. Adapted from nixkeeper's.
#
#   bash scripts/data-branch.sh restore [--required]
#       a branch "data" at main, with data/ as last published; on the first
#       run there's none yet (--required: fail instead)
#   bash scripts/data-branch.sh publish MESSAGE
#       commit data/ on main and replace the data branch with it, unless the
#       data is the same as last published
#
# For the workflows' checkouts: it makes nixkeeper-bot the committer there.
#
# Starting from no digest means reading every source from the start again,
# so restore only does that when the branch surely doesn't exist: if GitHub
# can't be asked, it fails instead.
